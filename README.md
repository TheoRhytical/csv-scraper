# PalayStat Scraper

Scraping palaystat.philrice.gov.ph 'cause this government site so shitty, I can't be assed to click all these links. Seriously, this doesn't need SPA-like flow, and the tables could be loaded with datatables then the payload sent as JSON. Then have the filter on the datatables. Along with the download button. SMH ðŸ˜’ PH Gov SitesðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž


Anywayyyy

TODO:

* [ ] Scrape this: https://palaystat.philrice.gov.ph/statistics/
* [ ] Preprocess data 'cause the formatting is so shit and unusable
* [ ] Explore the data
